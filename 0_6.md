    participant browser
    participant server
   
    When a user wants to send an input message, the browser sends a single post request to the server this time
    browser -> server: POST new_note_spa
    activate server
    server adds the new note
    server -> browser: payload that contains the new resource
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes

    the server creates the new note, which came as a json form with content-type as application/json with the help of a javascript file fetched from the server earlier and adds it to the list, but this time server doesn't order the browser to redirect since it isn't needed.
